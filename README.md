# ByteMe
A minimal snake game, but you control the snake with your voice.

## Features
* A score counter included, which tells you how many berries the snake has eaten at the end of the game.
* Control it with your Voice!!! Say "up", "down", "left" and "right" to control the snake.

## How to start
* clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/theParanoidScripts/ByteMe.git
```
* Go to the directory
```
cd ByteMe/
```
* Start the project using your favorite browser.

### Issues
* The control may be a bit gimmicky, as the model is not always accurate.
* Needs Internet connection to work, so as to load the model and some important libraries.



Still a Work-In-Progress, and needs time to be developed.
